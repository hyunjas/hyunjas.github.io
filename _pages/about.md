I am a first-year Software Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine, where I work under the guidance of Professor Iftekhar Ahmed in the STAIRS lab. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to solve software engineering tasks. Prior to joining UC Irvine, I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at Kookmin University.
